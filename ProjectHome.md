# CuPoisson #
CuPoisson is a GPU implementation of the 2D fast Poisson solver using CUDA. The method solves the discrete Poisson equation  on a rectangular grid, assuming zero Dirichlet boundary conditions.

This code is the result of a master's thesis written by Folkert Bleichrodt at Utrecht University under the supervision of Henk Dijkstra and Rob Bisseling.
A scientific paper has been published, discussing the Poisson solver as part
of a method for solving a 2D PDE ocean model. The paper can be downloaded at: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2011.10.001
